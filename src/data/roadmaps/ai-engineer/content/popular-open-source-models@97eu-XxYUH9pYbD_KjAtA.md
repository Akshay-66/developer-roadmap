# Popular Open Source Models

Popular open-source AI models include a variety of large language models (LLMs) and frameworks that cater to different applications. Notable examples are `BERT`, developed by Google, which has become a foundational model for natural language processing tasks; `BLOOM`, a multilingual model with 176 billion parameters created through a collaborative project by Hugging Face; and `Falcon 180B`, known for its impressive performance in NLP tasks. Other significant models include `GPT-Neo` and `GPT-J` from EleutherAI, which serve as accessible alternatives to proprietary models, and `OPT-175B` and `Llama's` series of models from Meta, which offers advanced capabilities under a non-commercial license. Additionally, `frameworks` like `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` provide robust environments for building and deploying AI applications, making them essential tools for developers in the open-source community.
